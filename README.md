1. Two Sum
2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
3. Longest Palindromic Substring
4. Container With Most Water
    - You are given an integer array `height` of length n. There are `n`
    vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i<sup>ith</sup>`
    line are `(i,0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

    Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that
    the container contains the most water.

    Return *the maximum amount of water a container can store*.

    **Notice** that you may not slant the container.
5. 3Sum
    - Given an integer array nums, return all triplets `[nums[i], nums[j],
    nums[k]]` such that `i !=j, i!=k` and `j !=k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] +
    nums[k] == 0`.

    **Notice** that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
