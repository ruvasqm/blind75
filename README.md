# Blind75 software interview questions

1. Two Sum
2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
3. Longest Palindromic Substring
4. Container With Most Water
    You are given an integer array `height` of length n. There are `n`
    vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i<sup>ith</sup>`
    line are `(i,0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

    Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that
    the container contains the most water.

    Return *the maximum amount of water a container can store*.

    **Notice** that you may not slant the container.
5. 3Sum
    Given an integer array nums, return all triplets `[nums[i], nums[j],
    nums[k]]` such that `i !=j, i!=k` and `j !=k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] +
    nums[k] == 0`.

    **Notice** that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
6. Remove Nth Node from end of list
    Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `n<super>th</super>` node
    from the end of the list and return its head.
7. Valid parentheses
    Given a string `s` containig just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`,
    `'}'`, `'['`, and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

    An input string is valid if:

    Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.

    Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

    Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
8. Merge two sorted lists

    You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

    Merge the two lists in a **one sorted list**. The list should be made by
    splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

    Return *the head of the merged linked list*.
